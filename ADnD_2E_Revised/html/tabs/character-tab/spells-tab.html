        </ul>
        <b>Learning new spells</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Wizards do not need to cast <em>read magic</em> to decipher spell books. The language of magic is a universal language (Sage Advice #175 p. 77)</li>

            <li>A check is made to see if a spell can be learned. If it fails, another check can be made after the wizard advances to the next level (provided the wizard still has access to the spell) (PHB p. 22)</li>
            <li>Both versions of a reversible spell is recorded in the wizard's spell book (PHB p. 168)</li>

                    <li>The time and cost required is halved (DMG p. 61)</li>
                    <li>Scroll Research can never be done in an adventuring situation. The wizard must have carefully controlled conditions to even attempt it. (DMG p. 61)</li>
                    <li>Regardless of success or failure of the research, the scroll is destroyed. (DMG p. 61)</li>

He may consult a sage, seek the guidance of a higher level spellcaster, or even use spells to call upon greater powers. (DMG p.117-119)
