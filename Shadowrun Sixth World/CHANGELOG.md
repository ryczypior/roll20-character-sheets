Change Log
==============================================
**2022-03-15 ** v.51 Chuz (James Culp)
	Bugfix - Sprites -> update power/skills now updated when sprite type or level are changed.
	Bugfix - NPCs had a maximum essence of 6, HMHVV victims can have >6 essence.
	New Feature - actually got in in v.50 - Damage Compensators are now supported as advanced modifications using 'damage_compensator: x' where 'x' is the level of damage compensators.
	New Feature - actually got in in v.50 - Resist Pain (per the spell) can be applied to wounds if advanced modifications are on, currently you can add it as a quality -> Modification 'resist_pain: x' where 'x' is the number of hits (wound penalties ignored)
	Bugfix - Fixed text color for some text on the NPC sheets in darkmode.
	Bugfix - Fixed maximum of 4 on npc initiative dice (should be 5)
	Updated Matrix Roll buttons in the Rolls tab to "Training Level?" because it now also includes an option for Untrained (-1 dicepool)

	Bugfix - NPC sheets made a few dark mode fixes.
**2022-03-08 ** v.50 Chuz (James Culp)
	Bugfix - updated spirit sheet to default to having the "Reset" toggle on since the majority of the time having it on is the right choice.
	Bugfix - updated spirits with Engulf and Elemental Attack close/ranged attacks listed even though they are optional power to now state the optional power is required in the notes.  This is a gentle reminder to players/GMs since the alternative is the player/GM having to add the attacks every time a spirit is summoned.
